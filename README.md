# C# Learning Journey 

Welcome to my C# learning journey!  In this repository, you'll find code snippets and solutions I created while learning C#. The code is organized into sections based on specific concepts, with clear comments and explanations. Feel free to explore, learn, and **contribute**!

## C# levels 

* **[![Beginner in C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-Beginner-green.svg)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/get-started/)**
* **[![Intermediate in C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-Intermediate-orange.svg)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/)**
* **[![Advanced in C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-Advanced-red.svg)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/advanced/)**

Choose the badge(s) that reflect your current level! As you progress, update the badges to mark your achievements.

## Code Structure 

This repository is divided into code blocks based on C# topics:

* **Basics:** `Console.WriteLine`, variables, data types, operators, control flow
* **Objects & Classes:** Defining classes, objects, methods, properties
* **Collections & Arrays:** Loops, lists, arrays, dictionaries
* **Exception Handling:** Try-catch blocks, error handling
* **Advanced Topics:** Delegates, lambdas, events, asynchronous programming

Each code block contains code snippets and solutions, marked with comments like:

```csharp

/* Each 3 Line GAP means NEW QUESTION SOLUTION */

// Solution 1: Using Math.PI constant
|
|  3 Lines GAP means NEW SOLUTION
|
// Solution 2: Using a custom function

```
